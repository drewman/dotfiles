(setq org-agenda-files (cons "~/.doom.d/config.org"(directory-files-recursively "~/org/notes" "\\.org$")))
#+END_SRC
*** Links
Set link file path to always use absolute paths. This should help links not break when refiling (so long as files never move :)
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-link-file-path-type "absolute")
#+END_SRC
*** Deft
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq deft-directory "~/org")
(setq deft-extensions '("txt" "tex" "org"))
(setq deft-recursive t)
#+END_SRC
*** Refiling
Allow refiling to anything in the org directory, up to one bullet point. More bullet points makes refiling slow.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defvar my/refile-targets
  (mapcar 'abbreviate-file-name
          (split-string
           (shell-command-to-string "find -L ~/org -name '*.org'") "\n")))

#+END_SRC
*** Keybinds
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

#+END_SRC
*** Todos
I dislike dooms todo system, so set it back to the default (TODO, DONE).
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

#+END_SRC
*** Capture Templates
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

*** Babel
When running org-babel-tangle with ':comments org|both' strip out properties from comments.
I have no desire to include Emacs specific properties as comments in my script.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun my/remove-properties (str)
    (string-join (seq-filter (lambda (st) (not (string-prefix-p ":" st))) (split-string str "\n")) "\n"))
(setq org-babel-process-comment-text 'my/remove-properties)
#+END_SRC
*** Export to confluence
"Confluence markdown" is dissimilar enough to standard markdown that I want to be able to export directly to confluence markup.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'ox-confluence)
#+END_SRC
** Global binds
The ESC key is too far away. 'jk' is much easier to move to normal mode. (This is the doom default but included for specificity)
The doom default is to exclude for visual mode (as well as normal, multiedit, emacs, and motion) but I don't want to use it in visual mode as well. I have rewrite ~evil-escape-excluded-states~ based on the way doom configures evil-escape.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(after! evil-escape
        (setq evil-escape-excluded-states '(normal multiedit emacs motion))
        (setq evil-escape-key-sequence "jk"))
#+END_SRC
Convenience binds for all modes.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(map! :leader
      :desc "M-x" "x" #'counsel-M-x
      :desc "other-window" "w o" #'other-window
      :desc "org-capture" "n n" #'org-roam-capture
      :desc "org-today" "n j" #'org-roam-dailies-today)
#+END_SRC
Set alt-leader to C-space instead of M-space to not conflict with my system binds.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq doom-leader-alt-key "C-SPC")
(setq doom-localleader-alt-key "C-SPC m")
#+END_SRC
** Time stamps
Add time-stamps to Time-stamp: <> (in first 8 lines) when writing files
Not working very well for me ATM. Exporting timestamps is awkward.)
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(after! time-stamp
  (add-hook 'write-file-functions 'time-stamp))
#+END_SRC
*** TODO [#C] Change time-stamp to '#+LAST_MODIFIED'

discusses a solution
** Elfeed
Elfeed goodies make elfeed look a lot nicer. Since it's not included with doom, need to run the setup function.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(elfeed-goodies/setup)
#+END_SRC
** Scratch
*** Initial mode
Doom sets the scratch initial major mode to fundamental which sucks for lisp autocompletion.
Instead of changing the mode everytime, just start in lisp mode.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq initial-major-mode 'lisp-interaction-mode)
#+END_SRC
*** Initial message
Put in initial message in the scratch buffer to help me remember stuff.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq initial-scratch-message "\
;; This buffer is for notes you don't want to save, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; If you want to create a file, visit that file with C-x C-f,
;; then enter the text in that file's own buffer.")
#+END_SRC
** Modeline
*** Time
Trying having the time in the modeline to see if I like it.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(display-time-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
** Shell
*** exec-path-from-shell
I've added exec-path-from-shell to (hopefully) resolve some of the issues where code is producing a different result in emacs.
Since, it's not included with doom, we have to initialize it (for macos and linux systems only).
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(after! exec-path-from-shell
  (when (memq window-system '(mac ns x))
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)))
#+END_SRC
** IRC
Setup circe with password from ~/.private.el
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(load! "~/.private.el")

(after! circe
  (setq circe-network-options
      `(("Freenode"
         :nick "bobtheorc"
         :channels ("#emacs" "#emacs-circe")
         :nickserv-password ,freenode-password))))
